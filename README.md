# Nobuyuki Fujioka

## Self-Driven Junior Full Stack Developer
I am a passionate and keen learner and coder for web development, and just graduated from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) - 4-months intensive coding bootcamp.

As my hobby and business, I have also been tutoring primary school children using the traditional Japanese abacus combined with mobile web technology, using my online platform.

Alongside the full-time makers academy programme and teaching, I have been working on my personal coding projects every evening.  Please have a look at some of my projects below.

I also have a solid project management experience working for international manufacturing companies in the past.
