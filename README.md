# Nobuyuki Fujioka

## Self-Driven Full Stack Web Developer
I am passionate about coding for web development, recently graduating from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) - 4-month intensive coding bootcamp.

I became interested in coding whilst developing a mobile-responsive online platform for my small business tutoring children using the Japanese abacus.  

Alongside the full-time makers academy programme and teaching, I have been working on personal coding projects, some of which are linked below.

I have nine years' project management experience in international manufacturing companies, including Foxconn and Sanyo.
